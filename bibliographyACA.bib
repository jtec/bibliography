	factor autopilot for a class of 155-mm spin-stabilized ammunition
	which incorporates a novel nose-positioned course correction fuze
	system used for trajectory correction. The projectile full nonlinear
	model is discussed and a procedure for obtaining the system q-LPV
	model necessary for control synthesis is exposed. Important properties
	relevant to axis cross-coupling, internal modes and stability properties
	specific to this kind of system are also highlighted. A comparison
	of full- and reduced-order mixed-sensitivity H ∞ linear compensators
	with an additional model following constraint for the design of the
	projectile autopilot is presented. Robust stability with respect
	to aerodynamic and actuator/sensor modeling uncertainties is verified
	via standard μ-analysis tools throughout the projectile flight envelope.
	Nonlinear 7-DoF trajectory simulation results are finally presented
	for a single or dual control surface actuator configuration. },
